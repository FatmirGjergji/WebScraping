# Comprehensive Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup & Selenium
In this projec, I used BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape data from multiple websites, including 
<ul>
  <li>Books to scrape</li>
  <li> Zillow </li>
  <li>Mathjobs</li>
  <li>Yelp, and more</li>
</ul>

  The project automates data collection for insights into real estate academic job listings, costumes reviews, and online book inventories. Link
